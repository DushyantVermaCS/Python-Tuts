'''Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h.
To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames,
consisting of the new filenames. Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods
youâ€™ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.'''

#Ans:

filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
newfilenames=[]
for fname in filenames:
    if fname.endswith("hpp"):
        fname=fname.replace("hpp","h")
        newfilenames.append(fname)
    else:
        newfilenames.append(fname)    

print(newfilenames) 
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
